For the most part i got the assignmet. I kept redoing the code trying to follow different ways of assembling the site opting to eventually do the more difficult quiz. I kept running into the problem 

"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'innerHTML' of null
    at showQuestions" i looked it up and couldnt understand what it said. 

The timer also wasnt function properly at first but im working on fixing it at the moment.
