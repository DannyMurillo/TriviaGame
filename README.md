Hw 5

For the most part i got the assignmet. I kept redoing the code trying to follow different ways of assembling the site opting to eventually do the more difficult quiz. I kept running into the problem 

"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'innerHTML' of null
    at showQuestions" i looked it up and couldnt understand what it said. 

    --- was remedied by changing the place of my script. Simple mistake that i shouldve gotten earlier

The score wont record correctly so working on that too

The timer also wasnt functioning properly at first but im working on fixing it at the moment. 

got a timer to work and count down from 30 seconds on the screen but it ends at 1 second because i havent linked it to the quiz meaning that i have yet to make it stop at 0 and end the quiz.
